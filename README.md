# Gunmetal motor mount
This repo provides .dxf projects of a motor mount for an electric skateboard
with Gunmetal trucks (tested with Gunmetal Mac 10 V2). It is designed for
50mm outrunner BLDC motors.

The mount consists of two parts:
* ring - a part to clamp on the truck
* plate - where the motor is attached, plate itself is attached to the ring

Both parts are intended to be laser cut.
